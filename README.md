HELP-GFOSS
This is my official GSOC-2023 proposal for GFOSS Technologies and Alliance , Sugar labs.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
HELP
Brief Explanation
Brief explanation=HELP is a location based mobile application (LBMA) with integrated emergency communications service, which includes an inbound and an outbound component similar to 112 or 911. You may use it with or without dialing 112 or 911 for free in any emergency anywhere (within available mobile network reception). The inbound component allows you to receive warnings or assistance of any kind and possibly allowing remote usage for the phone to light the flashlight for example or send a voice message. The outbound component will sent automatically location and other data if they are available (from any connected device like smartwatches or other health / sport devices) via multiple technologies and communication channels in case of imminent or occurring incident or dangerous situation constituting an immediate threat to your health and safety, so that you can report the incident and be reached and receive any kind of assistance. This application uses location to provide products or services based on information obtained from one or more smart devices. However, implementation and execution of these services may raise users privacy concerns related to sensitive information being handled so it has to be a FLOSS core application with possible plugins / add-ons for medical or other kind of assistance. On a later phase this application can be installed by default in any smartphone or similar device and will be available on any emergency even without SIM like 112/911.
